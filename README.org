#+TITLE: Cloudstrap
#+SUBTITLE: Strapping Boots to Clouds
#+LATEX: \pagebreak

* Overview

=cloudstrap= straps your boots to the cloud. Think of it as sort of a
meta-bootstrap tool. It handles pre-bootstrapping, primarily. Once complete, you
should have an environment suitable for launching your bootstrapper.

* Why does this exist?

To simplify deployment by replacing manual process with glorious automation.

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  gem install --pre cloudstrap
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Simply run the automated bootstrap tool. You can configure it via ENV or =config.yaml=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
 env BOOTSTRAP_WITHOUT_HUMAN_OVERSIGHT=true cloudstrap
#+END_SRC

The output describes the results, and all settings used in the process.

  Contratulations! Your Jumpbox is ready. This instance has been configured with
  everything you need to deploy your very own cluster. The SSH key used by this
  process has been uploaded to your Jumpbox, along with a bootstrap.properties
  file that has been configured to match the settings used here.

  Human oversight has been disabled.

  Now would be a good time for tea and swordplay (https://xkcd.com/303/). What
  happens next is non-interactive and will take approximately 30 minutes.
