#+TITLE: Cloudstrap
#+SUBTITLE: Strapping Boots to Clouds
#+LATEX: \pagebreak

* Status

  Cloudstrap is not being actively developed right now, due to lack of available
  AWS resources for testing. The current release (=0.49.4=) is feature-complete,
  with few known bugs (see Issues on GitHub).

  - Issues should still be reported, and will be fixed if development resumes.
  - Pull Requests are welcome, and will continue to be reviewed.

  There are a few very minor changes I would like to see before I would be
  comfortable calling this =1.0.0=, mostly regarding namespacing of environment
  variables (=BOOTSTRAP_*= -> =CLOUDSTRAP_*=), and restructuring the CLI
  (~cloudstrap-teardown~ is not Cloudstrap-specific, and should be a standalone
  tool).

* Overview

=cloudstrap= straps your boots to the cloud. Think of it as sort of a
meta-bootstrap tool. It handles pre-bootstrapping, primarily. Once complete, you
should have an environment suitable for launching your bootstrapper.

* Why does this exist?

To simplify deployment by replacing manual process with glorious automation.

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  gem install --pre cloudstrap
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Simply run the automated bootstrap tool. You can configure it via ENV or =config.yaml=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
 env BOOTSTRAP_WITHOUT_HUMAN_OVERSIGHT=true cloudstrap
#+END_SRC

The output describes the results, and all settings used in the process.

  Contratulations! Your Jumpbox is ready. This instance has been configured with
  everything you need to deploy your very own cluster. The SSH key used by this
  process has been uploaded to your Jumpbox, along with a bootstrap.properties
  file that has been configured to match the settings used here.

  Human oversight has been disabled.

  Now would be a good time for tea and swordplay (https://xkcd.com/303/). What
  happens next is non-interactive and will take approximately 30 minutes.
